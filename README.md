This project packages Keyple Interop Distributed Client libraries as a convenient XCFramework for seamless integration into iOS applications.

## Overview
It acts as an umbrella, packaging:

*   [Keyple Interop Distributed JSON API Client](https://github.com/eclipse-keyple/keyple-interop-jsonapi-client-kmp-lib): Enables communication with remote Keyple-compliant services using a JSON API.
*   [Keyple Interop NFC Mobile Local Reader](https://github.com/eclipse-keyple/keyple-interop-localreader-nfcmobile-kmp-lib): Facilitates interaction with local NFC card readers on mobile devices.


### Key Features

*   Provides a ready-to-use XCFramework for integrating Keyple Interop Distributed Client functionality into iOS apps.
*   Includes helper utilities (e.g. for logging) to streamline development.
*   Enables your iOS application to communicate with remote Keyple services and interact with smart cards via local NFC readers.

### Target Audience

iOS developers building applications that require:
*   Secure element interaction capabilities.
*   Communication with smart cards via NFC.
*   Interaction with remote Keyple-compliant services.

Refer to [Keyple Interop Distributed JSON API Client](https://github.com/eclipse-keyple/keyple-interop-jsonapi-client-kmp-lib) for code usage.

Note: A Kotlin Multiplatform Mobile implementation is demonstrated in the project [Keyple Demo Ticketing](https://github.com/calypsonet/keyple-demo-ticketing/tree/main/src/reloading-remote/client/interop-mobile-multiplatform)
